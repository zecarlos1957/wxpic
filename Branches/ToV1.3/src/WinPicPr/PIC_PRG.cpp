 *
 * BY MICROCHIP'S QUALITY REQUIREMENTS, THIS IS **NOT**
 *   A PRODUCTION-GRADE PROGRAMMER !!!
 *
 * Revision history:
 *
 * ??-Feb-1994: V-0.0; started as a few routines to debug hardware.
 * 07-Mar-1994: V-0.1; first code to successfully program a 16C84.
 * 09-Mar-1994: V-0.2; fuse switches; 7407 support; H/W test.
 * 10-Mar-1994: V-0.3; LPT2, LPT3 and INHX8M support; cosmetic changes.
 * 30-Aug-1996: V-0.4; major re-write (10-Sep-96: added config warning).
 * 03-Apr-1998: V-0.5; 16F8x now default; added -osng switches.
 * 03-Apr-1998: V-0.5; identity and hardware header defined in config.h
 * 16-Sep-2000: V1.0,  Converted from Pp.c to PIC_PRG.cpp
 *                     for beta-release of DL4YHF's Windows-PIC-Programmer.
 *                     REMOVED ALL TAB CHARACTERS. Keep it this way.. thanks.
 * 04-Dec-2001: V1.1,  added support for PIC16F628 and PIC16C711 etc.
 * 2003-12-28:  V1.2,  Cured a bug caused by another LOUSY programming spec .
 *                     Search for label [lps1] in all sourcefiles
 * 2004-01-28:  V1.3,  Added support for 16F628A(!). Guess what..
 *                     They changed the programming specs again !
 * 2004-03-28:  V1.4,  Copied all string literals into TRANSLATION.C .
 *                     Looked for an algorithm suitable for the 16F630/676.
 *       (2004-03-30)  The lousy spec does not mention anything 'compatible'..
 *                     .. as always .. and instead of wasting hours comparing
 *                     the NEW PROGRAMMING SPECS FOR THE 16F630 (-baah-) with
 *       all other programming specs to find similarities / incompatibilities,
 *       WoBu decided to write three special algorithms following Microchips
 *       Specs from DS41191B !
 *    (Note: I now have dozens of different PIC programming specs
 *           on my harddisk, and they keep making new ones.
 *          The author is still waiting for the day when Microchip
 *          introduce a new chip and simply say "USE THE SAME PROGRAMMING
 *          ALGORITHM AS FOR THE PIC16Fxyz" -- which did not happen up to now.
 *          Instead they seem to be happily writing new programming specs
 *          over and over ! These folks should take some lessons at ATMEL..)
 *
 * 2005-02-18:  Tried to add support for a dsPIC30F201 after BUYING(!)
 *          a sample chip, since Microchip's sampling program didn't work.
 *          The algorithms are located in dsPIC_PRG.cpp, not here in PIC_PRG !
 *
 * 2005-04-XX:  Support for PIC18Fxxxx added by Martin van de Werff,
 *          located in a separate module.
 * 2005-05-01:  Began to add support for PIC10F20x ... totally different again
 * 2005-06-06:  Looked at the PIC16F7x programming specs because someone asked
 *          if it was possible to add support. Found out :
 *           - AGAIN a totally different method, this time TWO locations per write
 *           - some stupid person thought it was cool to write down binary numbers
 *             beginning with the LEAST(!) SIGNIFICANT BIT AT THE LEFT SIDE. Ouch !
 * 2005-06-06:  Looked at the PIC16F72 programming specs because the 16F72
 *             was not mentioned in the "PIC16F7X" programming specs. Found that..
 *           - They wrote another programming spec again (ONLY for the 16F72 - ARGH...),
 *             this time writing binary numbers (in the table of serial commands)
 *             with the MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT AT THE LEFT SIDE (like it should be).
 *             Is the PIC16F72 so much different from PIC16F73/74/76/77 ? ? ?
 *             At least the program flow charts looked the same, with
 *             two memory words at a time, so PIC_PRG_Program16F7X7() should
 *             theoretically work for PIC16F72 *AND* PIC16F73/74/76/77 .
 *             Conclusion: Author left everything as it was and went back
 *             to play with the ATmega48 with its BEAUTIFUL instruction set ;-)
 *
 * 2007-06-03:  A.Kibler added support for PIC12F609/615,16F610/616,
 *             which require the "End Programming" command .
 *             Modifications in PIC_PRG_Program16FXX() - thanks Andrew !
